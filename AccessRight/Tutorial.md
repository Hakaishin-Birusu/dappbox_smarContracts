   A good tutorial vedio on the Blockchain implementation if the you have good command over the Java Script or TypeScript .  
   As Type Script is the super script of the Java Script.  If you have no prior knowledge of JavaScript or TypeScript you
   can start learning from this and also learn the component you need to work on and implement and also will be a good source
   for the revision of the concepts .

  Tutorial on the DAPP -( Dencentralized App ) on the Angular -
  About the DAPP ->

    A decentralized application is an application run by many users on a decentralized network with trustless protocols.
    They are designed to avoid any single point of failure. They typically have tokens to reward users for providing computing power.

  -> https://www.scribd.com/document/387126779/Create-Your-First-Ethereum-Dapp-With-Web3-and-Vue-js-Part-1 -> 

   1) To work on the Dapp one must know Solidity so that it can be implemented with UI as the logical part of the App and create 
   a Decentralized Portal.

   2) After that one must know HTML , CSS and Angular and with the Web3js a simple HTML + Web3js connection and injected web help 
   when we want to work with the metamask also and also creat a path for web3 when its libraries are called .
 
   3) For only HTML work web3js is needed for the DAPP. And for the implementation of web3js pre-required knowledge of java script
   is needed.

   4) To test a general solidity Smart Contract one can go on the remix.ethereum.org for the same. 
    http://remix.ethereum.org.

   5) Should also know how to interact with the truffle and ganache and testrpc.

   The best tutorial to learn the solidity and if you want to learn any particluar component and implement the code in the 
   same , it might be the best tutorial to work on . Also if you have the knowledge of the soldiity and want to work on the same
   and not having idea of the pre-defined functions it is the easiest way to learn and know the code and functions.
